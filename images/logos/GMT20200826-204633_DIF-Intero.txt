00:33:13	Orie Steele (Transmute):	Is this on the DIF calendar / can we get it on there?
00:33:31	Sam Curren (TelegramSam):	Gotta bring your own popcorn though. :)
00:35:00	Markus Sabadello:	Love the detailed event information about Event Location, Food Menu, Lodging..

00:41:28	Nader Helmy:	Sorry my internet cut out, but I wanted to call attention to this parallel organization doing work in the DID space. They’re having an informational session on Sept 9 which you can sign up for here

00:42:21	Kaliya Identity Woman:	Ramesh just reached out to me - interesting.
00:43:20	Pam Dingle:	https://whimsical.com/VVRMbTi9bPsCqagmRVNGvm
00:46:32	Nader Helmy:	I don’t see Secure Data Storage (SDS) work on here
00:47:15	Orie Steele (Transmute):	Imo that feeling comes from DIDComm being an ever expanding set of things :)
00:47:39	Sam Curren (TelegramSam):	Or your understanding ever expanding on an existing vision. :)
00:48:34	Orie Steele (Transmute):	Where is the authorization server ?
00:48:40	Pam Dingle:	Thanks Nader - added storage!
00:51:58	Orie Steele (Transmute):	https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/charter-ietf-gnap/
00:52:02	Marty Reed:	where does the data standard that resides in the payload sit? ex. Comprehensive Learner Record, Interoperable Learner Record, Open Badges, 
00:52:03	Orie Steele (Transmute):	GNAP!
00:52:26	Markus Sabadello:	A few years ago, another group created a layer diagram for a new and free Internet: https://youbroketheinternet.org/map. In that diagram, most of the technologies address multiple layers of the stack.
00:52:33	Markus Sabadello:	https://youbroketheinternet.org/map
00:53:53	Orie Steele (Transmute):	QR/NFC => URL
00:54:08	Orie Steele (Transmute):	They are the same thing most of the time…
00:54:53	Tim Cappalli:	What's encoded in our QR code is a deep link
00:55:06	Tim Cappalli:	it's the same string
00:55:07	Orie Steele (Transmute):	A URL...
00:55:25	Orie Steele (Transmute):	Or URI
00:56:13	Orie Steele (Transmute):	Card is the Microsoft term for things that go in a wallet.
00:56:45	Orie Steele (Transmute):	We use the same term in universal wallet, to avoid creating more terminology
00:57:00	Tim Cappalli:	what is the generic term for an item in a wallet?
00:57:07	Orie Steele (Transmute):	Wallet content.
00:57:10	Tim Cappalli:	lol
00:57:13	Tim Cappalli:	or Card
00:57:14	Tim Cappalli:	:)
00:57:24	Orie Steele (Transmute):	I support you never stored a condom in your wallet ; )
00:57:29	Orie Steele (Transmute):	Suppose *
00:57:34	Tim Cappalli:	JFC
00:59:03	Orie Steele (Transmute):	I also store cash, family photos and sometimes physical keys in my wallet :)
00:59:23	Tim Cappalli:	What is "cash"?
00:59:37	Orie Steele (Transmute):	Proof you are not a boomer.

01:01:22	Orie Steele (Transmute):	Are OIDC “id_tokens” credentials?
01:01:26	Marty Reed:	https://www.uschamberfoundation.org/t3-innovation-network/ilr-pilot-program
01:01:46	Nader Helmy:	ZKPs are not a credential format

01:03:00	Nader Helmy:	I like Envelopes
01:03:03	Nader Helmy:	That feels generic
01:03:19	Orie Steele (Transmute):	If only someone had written a spec, with terms
01:03:23	Orie Steele (Transmute):	We could use
01:04:53	Nader Helmy:	Fuzzy Encryption Vault
01:04:58	Nader Helmy:	Horcrux

01:06:58	Orie Steele (Transmute):	Cosmos DB
01:07:05	Orie Steele (Transmute):	MySQL
01:08:24	Orie Steele (Transmute):	Ceramic is everything!
01:08:32	Nader Helmy:	Yeah Ceramic is super ambitious
01:08:53	Orie Steele (Transmute):	Ceramic and DIDComm should merge, and go super nova!
01:10:36	Orie Steele (Transmute):	Universal Wallet should also be in the schema bucket.
01:11:27	Nader Helmy:	I think to Marcus’s point earlier in the chat, that certain items/protocols span across more than one layer
01:11:38	Orie Steele (Transmute):	IPFS is storage
